      <p>The Technological Institute of the Philippines (T.I.P.) is one of the countryâ€™s premier technological, engineering, 
        and computing higher educational institutions.  It is a private non-sectarian stock school founded on February 8, 1962 by 
        a group of educators headed by Engineer Demetrio A. Quirino, Jr. and Dr. Teresita U. Quirino. Using an outcomes-based educational 
        model with its locally and globally accredited programs, T.I.P. allows students to acquire industry-desired qualities and essential 
        experiences that better equip them to be effective as soon as they enter the workforce or set up their own business.</p>

      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <p>The Archive is a T.I.P. exclusive web-based research compendium which aims to provide access on various resources published by its
        students for different studies.</p>
      <p>We aim to bridge the lack of access  to academic information and the availability of related literature for its students.</p>
